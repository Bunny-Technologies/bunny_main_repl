You are a senior full-stack engineer + UI designer.

Build a production-ready marketing website for “Bunny Innovations — AI + IoT + Cloud Solutions” that replicates the idea and structure of our PDF brochure.

TECH STACK:
Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS.
No database needed. Use a simple API route for the contact form.

GOAL:
The website should feel like an interactive version of the brochure:
- Same narrative flow
- Same modules (Agentic AI, IoT & Edge, Cloud & Data, Computer Vision & Digital Twins)
- Same “Pilot-to-Scale” delivery model
- Same Government/Civic use-cases, security posture, case studies, team, and CTA

DESIGN SYSTEM (match brochure vibe):
- Background: clean white
- Section dividers: subtle lines
- Colors: navy primary + orange accent + teal/green secondary accents for icons (keep consistent)
- Rounded cards, minimal shadows, plenty of whitespace
- Sticky header with anchor links (Home, Capabilities, Use-cases, Security, Pilot, Case studies, Team, Contact)
- Footer repeated on all pages with phone/email/website

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Contact form posts to /api/contact and logs payload to console + returns success (no external email required).
- WhatsApp CTA uses wa.me link placeholder using phone number.
